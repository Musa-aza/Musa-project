hello there!


I have tried to do this without any help and guides at the start which resulted as quite a painful and hard to work out task, but after looking at all the given resources i've managed to expand my knowledge and it was really cool to finding out stuff. I decided to expand my knowledge even outside given recources and managed to do lots more cool stuff. I even tried some js but i did get stuck there a bit, so I decided to bring it down a bit and continued with my css and html. I've even found out all by myself how to link several html files wich is really cool!

This has overall been great fun!
